# To-Do-App
Site is live! https://andrew-hinson.github.io/To-Do-App/

This is my unique take on a To-Do Application, I decided to veer away from most standard looking To-Do applications and make something that I thought kids (and kids at heart) could have fun interacting with. The color pallet is from ColorHunt.io https://colorhunt.co/palette/15830. The flip card addition and css fade animations are a first for me and are purely run on CSS and JS, I look forward in getting better at interactivity elements for my projects.


### Key goals 
* Single Responsibility Focus of classes, objects, and functions.
* Loosely Coupled Objects
* Local data save implimentation 
* Class use 
* Dynamic creation and removal of objects

# New Features:
* Local Storage is now live! You can have as many completed Todos as you want as long as its < 10 ;)
* Stat Tracking, implimented Chart.js tracking of ToDo's and completed Todo's.
* Updated styling, menu bar with more coherant styling.
* Mobile Styling and support. 
* Successfully tested hosting on Firebase, will be using in future projects more.



# Final Thoughts
This application has taught me a great deal, classes, ES6 module manipulation, Webpack configurations, CSS animations.
