# To-Do-App
Site is live! https://andrew-hinson.github.io/To-Do-App/


### Key goals 
* Single Responsibility Focus of classes, objects, and functions.
* Loosely Coupled Objects
* Local data save implimentation 
* Class use 
* Dynamic creation and removal of objects

# New Features:
* Local Storage is now live! You can have as many completed Todos as you want as long as its < 10 ;)
* Stat Tracking, implimented Chart.js tracking of ToDo's and completed Todo's.
* Updated styling, menu bar with more coherant styling.
* Mobile Styling and support. 
* Successfully tested hosting on Firebase, will be using in future projects more.



# Final Thoughts
This application has taught me a great deal, classes, ES6 module manipulation, Webpack configurations, CSS animations.
